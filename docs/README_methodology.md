This repo contains the framework-level structure for ELSA:  
\- /data → layer-based CSVs  
\- /validation → calibration \+ DCA outputs  
\- /ai\_engine → preprocessing \+ model training (future)  
\- /archive → snapshots for each validated version

Data is currently placeholder-level. Real evidence will be appended by ingestion scripts.
